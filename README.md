# GCD Anticheat V2 (WIP)
 A script that prevents players from cheating in certain Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers.

# Build
 Current Instructions:

1. Build the typescript project normally

2. Either place the script in the addon or as a standalone script

3. Include the additional non-built JS scripts like `config.js` and `nbt.js` from the src. If using addon, don't include the `nbt.js` and other ones that need a modded server
